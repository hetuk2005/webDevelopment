            <h3>React Introduction:-</h3>
            <p>ReactJS is a component-based JavaScript library used to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It simplifies the creation of single-page applications (SPAs) with a focus on performance and maintainability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is developed and maintained by Facebook.</li>
                <li>Uses a virtual DOM for faster updates.</li>
                <li>Supports a declarative approach to designing UI components.</li>
                <li>Ensures better application control with one-way data binding.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <h3>How Does React Work?</h3>
            <p>React operates by creating an in-memory virtual DOM rather than directly manipulating the browserâ€™s DOM. It performs necessary manipulations within this virtual representation before applying changes to the actual browser DOM.</p>
            <h5>Steps For How Does The Process Works:-</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Actual DOM and Virtual DOM</li>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initially, there is an Actual DOM(Real DOM) containing a div with two child elements: h1 and h2.</li>
                    <li>React maintains a previous Virtual DOM to track the UI state before any updates.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <li>Detecting Changes</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>When a change occurs (e.g., adding a new h3 element), React generates a New Virtual DOM.</li>
                    <li>React compares the previous Virtual DOM with the New Virtual DOM using a process called reconciliation.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <li>Efficient DOM Update</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>React identifies the differences (in this case, the new h3 element).</li>
                    <li>Instead of updating the entire DOM, React updates only the changed part in the New Actual DOM, making the update process more efficient.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h3>History Of React</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>React was developed by Facebook in 2011 to improve the performance of their applications and was officially released as an open-source library in 2013.</li>
                <li>It was designed to create dynamic, fast, and responsive user interfaces for web applications by focusing on the view layer.</li>
                <li>React introduced concepts like components (reusable UI pieces) and the virtual DOM (a lightweight copy of the real DOM) for optimizing UI updates.</li>
                <li>React is now a widely used framework for building modern web and mobile apps, supported by a strong community and major companies.</li>
            </ul>
